# Experience:

I have around 4 years of WPF (front-end) and C# (backend) experience.

For the past 3 co-op rotations, I've worked at SHP which is an architecture firm in downtown Cincinnati. 
While there, I created customizations for their 3D modeling software, Revit. 
I created the WPF standards for our company and unified our many projects. 
I also created icons and banners using Photoshop for each of our customizations. 
I also presented many whiteboarding sessions covering the best standards of WPF, 
ways to abstract our code more, and general explanations of tools and resources that should be utilized. 

Prior to my work at SHP, I worked at a small consulting firm, Martin and Associates. 
While there, I worked on customizing customers' financial software, Sage 100. 
I used a rendition of Visual Basic to create custom forms and procedures that would allow for a more efficient and effective workflow. 

The summer after my freshman year, I worked at a scientific measuring device manufacturer, Tegam. 
My role was to implement and code the procedure for a prototype micro-calorimeter 
that would later be used in the Airforce's calibration labs. I used WPF to design the front-end and C# for the back-end. 
I also needed to read Visual Basic code provided by NIST to help with the procedure design. 
 

# Ideal Capstone Project:

I would like to work on a stock trading platform that utilizes TD Ameritrade's API in order to retrieve the data, 
a MySQL database to store the information, and a UI whose language is undecided (maybe Python, Node, React, or Javascript).
